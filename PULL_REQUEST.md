# Authentication and Routing System Improvements

## Changes Made

### Authentication
- Implemented proper role-based authentication using Supabase
- Added middleware for route protection and role-based access control
- Created dedicated auth utilities in `lib/auth.ts`
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### Routing
- Implemented role-specific routing logic
- Added route guards in layout components
- Created separate layouts for auth and dashboard sections
- Added proper redirection based on user roles

### Code Organization
- Removed unused dependencies and code
- Simplified providers structure
- Improved type safety throughout the application
- Added proper error boundaries and loading states

### Package.json Updates
- Removed unused scripts and dependencies
- Updated core dependencies to latest stable versions
- Simplified build and development scripts

## Testing Instructions
1. Test login with both roles:
   - ROUTING_ADMIN: routing@zenflow.com
   - PICKING_ADMIN: picking@zenflow.com

2. Verify route access:
   - ROUTING_ADMIN should only access: /dashboard, /routes, /drivers, /orders
   - PICKING_ADMIN should only access: /dashboard, /picking-lists, /users, /picking-orders

3. Test authentication flows:
   - Login redirect to role-specific home page
   - Logout redirect to login page
   - Protected route access
   - Invalid route handling

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `src/middleware.ts`: Added role-based route protection
- `src/providers/auth-provider.tsx`: Improved auth context and session handling
- `src/lib/auth.ts`: Added centralized auth utilities
- `package.json`: Cleaned up dependencies

### Security Considerations
- All routes are now properly protected
- Role-based access control is enforced at middleware level
- Session handling is more robust
- Proper error handling for auth failures

## Breaking Changes
- Route structure has changed to support role-based access
- Auth provider API has been simplified
- Some unused dependencies have been removed

## Future Improvements
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Implement refresh token rotation
- Add session timeout handling
- Improve loading states and transitions
